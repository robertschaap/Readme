# Readme
Hi there, I'm Robert, a web developer from Amsterdam. This GitHub profile serves as my personal testing grounds, where I play around and put projects that I'm working on.

If you're looking for my portfolio, please go to @colorcodedcode. Please note that I do test out projects that go to my portfolio here first, but if you're looking for the final and most up to date version, it will always be there.
